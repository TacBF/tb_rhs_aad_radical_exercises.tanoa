<*> A few days ago our leader stole the "Made in USSR" to make a revolution in the country. He put "Made in USSR" in the crater of the volcano Mont Tanoa.
But suddenly NATO heads to conduct exercises on the island. Why NATO, conducting training, climbed on the same mountain is not clear. 
And why their plane dropped the boxes on the island is also not clear to anyone. 
In general, we have a chance to be well armed. Our equipment in these boxes on the island Sosovu. Hurry up to them goes the enemy. At the same time help the leader to pick up his toys.<br />
